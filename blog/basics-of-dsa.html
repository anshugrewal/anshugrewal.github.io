## 📘 What is DSA?

**DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** is the foundation of computer science — used to store, organize, and process data efficiently.

### 🧱 Data Structures (DS)
These are ways to organize data:
- **Array** – Fixed-size, index-based collection
- **Linked List** – Nodes connected via pointers
- **Stack** – Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
- **Queue** – First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- **Hash Table** – Key-value storage
- **Tree** – Hierarchical structure
- **Graph** – Nodes and edges, perfect for networks

### ⚙️ Algorithms (A)
Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve problems:
- **Sorting** – Bubble, Merge, Quick Sort
- **Searching** – Linear, Binary Search
- **Recursion** – When a function calls itself
- **Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking** – Advanced strategies

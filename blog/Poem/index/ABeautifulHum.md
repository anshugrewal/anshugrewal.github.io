# 🌿 A Beautiful Hum 🌿

> I asked the day, “what are you made of?”  
> It whispered back, “moments you often forget.”  

> And life?  
> It’s not a grand speech or a perfect rhyme,  
> just a clumsy dance of loss and find,  
> a joke half-told,  
> a song half-sung,  
> yet still—it beats, a beautiful hum.
